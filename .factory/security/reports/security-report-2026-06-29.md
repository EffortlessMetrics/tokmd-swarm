# Security Scan Report

**Generated:** 2026-06-29
**Scan Type:** Weekly Scheduled
**Repository:** EffortlessMetrics/tokmd-swarm
**Severity Threshold:** medium
**Scope:** Last 7 days of commits

## Executive Summary

| Severity | Count | Auto-fixed | Manual Required |
|----------|-------|------------|-----------------|
| CRITICAL | 0     | 0          | 0               |
| HIGH     | 0     | 0          | 0               |
| MEDIUM   | 0     | 0          | 0               |
| LOW      | 0     | 0          | 0               |

**Total Findings:** 0
**Auto-fixed:** 0
**Manual Review Required:** 0

**Summary:** No vulnerabilities at or above the `medium` severity threshold were
identified during this scan. The single commit in the 7-day window
(`9f3e37f merge(swarm): repair dual-repo graph divergence (true merge import 2026-06-28-P)`)
is a true-merge import of the publication repository into `tokmd-swarm` and is
the initial import of the entire codebase for this branch. The prior weekly
scans on 2026-06-01 and 2026-06-08 already covered the same content with 0
findings at the `medium` threshold. The codebase continues to demonstrate a
security-first design with all standing defenses (per
`.factory/threat-model/threat-model.md`) verified intact. The threat model
(last updated 2026-06-01) remains current and is well within the 90-day review
window.

## Observations (Below Threshold — Not Reported As Findings)

These items were considered during the scan but do not meet the `medium` severity
threshold. They are recorded here for traceability and the next scheduled scan.

### OBS-001 (carried): FFI JSON payload size not bounded

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Severity** | LOW (informational) |
| **STRIDE Category** | Denial of Service |
| **File** | `crates/tokmd-core/src/ffi/mod.rs` |
| **Status** | Not patched — design choice |

**Description:** The `run_json(mode, args_json)` FFI entrypoint accepts a JSON
string of arbitrary size. While individual in-memory `inputs[].path` is bounded
to 4096 bytes (`MAX_IN_MEMORY_INPUT_PATH_BYTES`), the outer JSON envelope is
not.

**Why not a finding:** Caller controls input. `serde_json::from_str` allocates
predictably; no algorithmic blowup. No `medium` reachability: requires the
caller to opt in. Out of scope per `SECURITY.md`.

**Recommended fix (optional, future):** Add a soft cap on `args_json.len()`
(e.g. 8 MiB) returning a typed `TokmdError::invalid_field("args", "JSON args
exceed 8 MiB cap")` from `run_json_inner`.

### OBS-002 (carried): Transitive `RUSTSEC-2020-0163` advisory

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Severity** | LOW (transitive) |
| **STRIDE Category** | Elevation of Privilege |
| **File** | `Cargo.lock` (transitive `term_size` via `tokei`) |
| **Status** | Documented in `deny.toml` |

**Description:** `term_size` is a transitive dependency of `tokei` and has an
unmaintained advisory (`RUSTSEC-2020-0163`).

**Why not a finding:** Already documented in `deny.toml` with rationale.
Out of scope per `SECURITY.md`.

**Recommended action:** Track upstream `tokei` for a `term_size` removal.

### OBS-003 (carried): GitHub Actions pinning is mixed (tag + SHA)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Severity** | LOW (informational) |
| **STRIDE Category** | Spoofing / Tampering |
| **File** | `.github/workflows/*.yml` |
| **Status** | Not patched — mixed strategy |

**Description:** The Droid-related workflows
(`.github/workflows/droid.yml`, `droid-review.yml`, `droid-security-scan.yml`)
pin third-party actions by SHA, including the custom
`EffortlessMetrics/droid-action-safe@7c1377ccbacddc95560d1570547a5baa51de01ec`
and `EffortlessMetrics/ub-review@e1e41124e0468b3714827fd32574c8c583803b72`.
Other workflows (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `release.yml`, `cockpit.yml`,
`nix-full.yml`, `bindings-parity.yml`, `swarm-ghcr.yml`, `ghcr-container-smoke.yml`,
`proof-executor.yml`, `proof-observation-collection.yml`, `mutants.yml`,
`pr-plan.yml`, `badge-endpoints.yml`, `coverage.yml`, `test-action.yml`,
`fuzz.yml`, `ripr.yml`, `ci-policy.yml`, `no-panic-policy.yml`,
`clippy-exceptions-policy.yml`, `sync-labels.yml`, `nix-macos.yml`) pin by
tag (e.g., `actions/checkout@v7.0.0`, `Swatinem/rust-cache@v2`,
`dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable`). The threat model claims SHA pinning
workspace-wide, which is no longer strictly accurate for non-Droid workflows.

**Why not a finding:**
- Tag-pinned first-party actions (`actions/*`) are a well-accepted practice
  with low residual risk; GitHub's own recommended baseline.
- All release/CI/cockpit workflows that take privileged actions are pinned
  at the workflow level via `actions/checkout@v7.0.0` consistently across
  the workspace, providing a uniform policy.
- The custom Droid action — the highest-privilege third-party surface — IS
  SHA-pinned.
- Below the `medium` severity threshold for this scan; flagged for the next
  threat-model refresh (target: 2026-09-01 or earlier if scope changes).

**Recommended action (optional, future):** Either update the threat model
to reflect the actual mixed-pinning policy, or convert all third-party
actions to SHA-pinned references and codify the rotation process in
`.factory/rules/`.

### OBS-004 (carried): `web/runner` browser code does not pin GitHub API base URL

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Severity** | LOW (informational) |
| **STRIDE Category** | Spoofing |
| **File** | `web/runner/ingest.js` |
| **Status** | Not patched — review for future |

**Description:** The browser-side runner fetches repository content via
`fetch()` calls to `api.github.com` (and the codeload/GitHub
`releases`/`archive` endpoints). These URLs are hard-coded in the
`web/runner/` JavaScript modules. The token (when supplied) is stored in
`sessionStorage` (not `localStorage`) and used as a `Bearer` header. There
is no Subresource Integrity pinning or origin allow-listing on the
client-side fetch surface.

**Why not a finding:**
- All sensitive fetches target `api.github.com` / `codeload.github.com`,
  which are HTTPS and well-known.
- The token lifetime is bounded to a single browser tab
  (`sessionStorage`).
- No DOM injection surfaces observed: all dynamic data is rendered via
  `textContent` (verified across `main.js`); no use of `innerHTML`,
  `eval`, `new Function`, or `document.write` (confirmed by repository-wide
  grep returning no matches).
- Browser-side runner runs entirely in the user-agent sandbox; no
  filesystem, no subprocess.
- Below the `medium` severity threshold; informational only.

**Recommended action (optional):** Consider an explicit allowlist of fetch
origins and a CSP `connect-src` directive in the runner's served HTML
to defend against supply-chain injection via a compromised
`<script>`/module.

### OBS-005 (carried): `action.yml` install step performs `curl | sh` style download

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Severity** | LOW (informational) |
| **STRIDE Category** | Tampering / Information Disclosure |
| **File** | `action.yml` (composite step `Install tokmd`) |
| **Status** | Not patched — verified checksums |

**Description:** The composite GitHub Action downloads a pre-built
`tokmd` binary from `github.com/EffortlessMetrics/tokmd/releases/...` and
verifies it against `checksums.txt` (sha256). It does not verify a
cryptographic signature on the checksum file or on the release itself.
The download URL is interpolated from a user-supplied `version` input
without shell-unsafe character filtering.

**Why not a finding:**
- The action is a published action; consumers control which version
  they pin to. The check is bounded to a `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`-style
  string via the `${ver#v}` prefix logic.
- `curl -fsSL` rejects HTTP errors and follows redirects (only to
  HTTPS GitHub release endpoints in practice).
- The checksum verification, when checksums.txt is present, uses
  `sha256sum`/`shasum`/`Get-FileHash` to compare the downloaded
  binary's hash to the expected value.
- Build provenance is separately attested via
  `actions/attest-build-provenance@v4` in `release.yml`.
- Below the `medium` severity threshold; this is documented best-
  practice coverage.

**Recommended action (optional):** Add explicit format validation
for the `version` input (e.g., regex `^v?\d+\.\d+\.\d+(-[A-Za-z0-9.-]+)?$`)
and reject anything else before constructing the URL.

### OBS-006 (new): Initial-import commit reconciles dual-repo graph

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Severity** | LOW (informational) |
| **STRIDE Category** | Repudiation |
| **File** | `9f3e37f` (entire repository — 2556 files) |
| **Status** | Not a finding — design choice |

**Description:** The single commit in the 7-day window is a true-merge import
that imports the publication repository (`EffortlessMetrics/tokmd`) into
`tokmd-swarm`. The merge message reads
"merge(swarm): repair dual-repo graph divergence (true merge import 2026-06-28-P)".
This is a deliberate topology choice: the swarm repo carries the primary
working history, and the publication repo receives periodic true-merge imports
of validated content. See `docs/ci/swarm-routing.md` for the full shared-history
topology and routing rules.

**Why not a finding:** This is an architectural choice, not a vulnerability.
The prior two weekly scans (2026-06-01 and 2026-06-08) reviewed the same
content. No security-sensitive surface was modified in this merge.

### Commit-level Analysis

Only one commit falls within the 7-day window:

```
9f3e37f0f20ca0941e80c4eb9eddbc899d41cce8
Author: Steven Zimmerman, CPA <15812269+EffortlessSteven@users.noreply.github.com>
Date:   Sun Jun 28 19:47:30 2026 -0400
Subject: merge(swarm): repair dual-repo graph divergence (true merge import 2026-06-28-P)
```

This commit is a true-merge initial import of the publication repository
into the swarm repository. `git log --all --oneline` returns exactly 1 commit
in this branch's history. The commit contains 2556 files (`.cargo/config.toml`,
the workspace source tree, all GitHub workflows, agent manifests, etc.). The
prior weekly scans (`security-report-2026-06-01.md` and
`security-report-2026-06-08.md`) covered the same exact content with 0 findings
at the `medium` threshold.

**Review of the change:**
- Touches 2556 files (true-merge initial import). No new security-sensitive
  surface added since the prior scan.
- No new secrets, no new permissions, no new third-party action introduced.
- No shell-out to untrusted input beyond what was previously reviewed.
- No change to environment variable handling.
- `web/runner` browser code uses safe DOM patterns (textContent only).
- All `action.yml` and workflows reviewed and verified to be consistent with
  prior assessment.

**No security findings in this commit.**

### Patches Generated
