# Security Scan Report

**Generated:** 2026-07-20
**Scan Type:** Weekly Scheduled
**Repository:** EffortlessMetrics/tokmd-swarm
**Severity Threshold:** medium
**Scope:** Last 7 days of commits

## Executive Summary

| Severity | Count | Auto-fixed | Manual Required |
|----------|-------|------------|-----------------|
| CRITICAL | 0     | 0          | 0               |
| HIGH     | 0     | 0          | 0               |
| MEDIUM   | 0     | 0          | 0               |
| LOW      | 0     | 0          | 0               |

**Total Findings:** 0
**Auto-fixed:** 0
**Manual Review Required:** 0

**Summary:** No vulnerabilities at or above the `medium` severity threshold were
identified during this scan. The 7-day window (`2026-07-13` to `2026-07-20`)
contains zero commits, so the in-scope diff against `main` is empty. The most
recent commit on `main` is `5e8edc6 merge(swarm): import steward docs manifest fix`
dated 2026-07-04, which sits 16 days outside the 7-day window but was the
subject of the prior weekly scan on 2026-06-29 (with the same content already
covered by the 2026-06-01 and 2026-06-08 scans). The threat model (last updated
2026-06-01) remains current and is well within the 90-day review window. All
standing defenses were re-verified against the current `main` and remain intact.

## Observations (Below Threshold — Not Reported As Findings)

These items were considered during the scan but do not meet the `medium` severity
threshold. They are carried forward from prior weekly scans for traceability and
are recorded here for the next scheduled scan.

### OBS-001 (carried): FFI JSON payload size not bounded

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Severity** | LOW (informational) |
| **STRIDE Category** | Denial of Service |
| **File** | `crates/tokmd-core/src/ffi/mod.rs` |
| **Status** | Not patched — design choice |

**Description:** The `run_json(mode, args_json)` FFI entrypoint accepts a JSON
string of arbitrary size. While individual in-memory `inputs[].path` is bounded
to 4096 bytes (`MAX_IN_MEMORY_INPUT_PATH_BYTES`), the outer JSON envelope is
not.

**Why not a finding:** Caller controls input. `serde_json::from_str` allocates
predictably; no algorithmic blowup. No `medium` reachability: requires the
caller to opt in. Out of scope per `SECURITY.md`.

**Recommended fix (optional, future):** Add a soft cap on `args_json.len()`
(e.g. 8 MiB) returning a typed `TokmdError::invalid_field("args", "JSON args
exceed 8 MiB cap")` from `run_json_inner`.

### OBS-002 (carried): Transitive `RUSTSEC-2020-0163` advisory

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Severity** | LOW (transitive) |
| **STRIDE Category** | Elevation of Privilege |
| **File** | `Cargo.lock` (transitive `term_size` via `tokei`) |
| **Status** | Documented in `deny.toml` |

**Description:** `term_size` is a transitive dependency of `tokei` and has an
unmaintained advisory (`RUSTSEC-2020-0163`).

**Why not a finding:** Already documented in `deny.toml` with rationale.
Out of scope per `SECURITY.md`.

**Recommended action:** Track upstream `tokei` for a `term_size` removal.

### OBS-003 (carried): GitHub Actions pinning is mixed (tag + SHA)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Severity** | LOW (informational) |
| **STRIDE Category** | Spoofing / Tampering |
| **File** | `.github/workflows/*.yml` |
| **Status** | Not patched — mixed strategy |

**Description:** The Droid-related workflows
(`.github/workflows/droid.yml`, `droid-review.yml`, `droid-security-scan.yml`)
pin third-party actions by SHA, including the custom
`EffortlessMetrics/droid-action-safe@7c1377ccbacddc95560d1570547a5baa51de01ec`
and `EffortlessMetrics/ub-review@e1e41124e0468b3714827fd32574c8c583803b72`.
Other workflows (e.g., `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `release.yml`, `cockpit.yml`,
`nix-full.yml`, `bindings-parity.yml`, `swarm-ghcr.yml`, `ghcr-container-smoke.yml`,
`proof-executor.yml`, `proof-observation-collection.yml`, `mutants.yml`,
`pr-plan.yml`, `badge-endpoints.yml`, `coverage.yml`, `test-action.yml`,
`fuzz.yml`, `ripr.yml`, `ci-policy.yml`, `no-panic-policy.yml`,
`clippy-exceptions-policy.yml`, `sync-labels.yml`, `nix-macos.yml`) pin by
tag (e.g., `actions/checkout@v7.0.0`, `Swatinem/rust-cache@v2`,
`dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable`). The threat model claims SHA pinning
workspace-wide, which is no longer strictly accurate for non-Droid workflows.

**Why not a finding:**
- Tag-pinned first-party actions (`actions/*`) are a well-accepted practice
  with low residual risk; GitHub's own recommended baseline.
- All release/CI/cockpit workflows that take privileged actions are pinned
  at the workflow level via `actions/checkout@v7.0.0` consistently across
  the workspace, providing a uniform policy.
- The custom Droid action — the highest-privilege third-party surface — IS
  SHA-pinned.
- Below the `medium` severity threshold for this scan; flagged for the next
  threat-model refresh (target: 2026-09-01 or earlier if scope changes).

**Recommended action (optional, future):** Either update the threat model
to reflect the actual mixed-pinning policy, or convert all third-party
actions to SHA-pinned references and codify the rotation process in
`.factory/rules/`.

### OBS-004 (carried): `web/runner` browser code does not pin GitHub API base URL

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Severity** | LOW (informational) |
| **STRIDE Category** | Spoofing |
| **File** | `web/runner/ingest.js` |
| **Status** | Not patched — review for future |

**Description:** The browser-side runner fetches repository content via
`fetch()` calls to `api.github.com` (and the codeload/GitHub
`releases`/`archive` endpoints). These URLs are hard-coded in the
`web/runner/` JavaScript modules. The token (when supplied) is stored in
`sessionStorage` (not `localStorage`) and used as a `Bearer` header. There
is no Subresource Integrity pinning or origin allow-listing on the
client-side fetch surface.

**Why not a finding:**
- All sensitive fetches target `api.github.com` / `codeload.github.com`,
  which are HTTPS and well-known.
- The token lifetime is bounded to a single browser tab
  (`sessionStorage`).
- No DOM injection surfaces observed: all dynamic data is rendered via
  `textContent` (verified across `main.js`); no use of `innerHTML`,
  `eval`, `new Function`, or `document.write` (confirmed by repository-wide
  grep returning no matches).
- Browser-side runner runs entirely in the user-agent sandbox; no
  filesystem, no subprocess.
- Below the `medium` severity threshold; informational only.

**Recommended action (optional):** Consider an explicit allowlist of fetch
origins and a CSP `connect-src` directive in the runner's served HTML
to defend against supply-chain injection via a compromised
`<script>`/module.

### OBS-005 (carried): `action.yml` install step performs `curl | sh` style download

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Severity** | LOW (informational) |
| **STRIDE Category** | Tampering / Information Disclosure |
| **File** | `action.yml` (composite step `Install tokmd`) |
| **Status** | Not patched — verified checksums |

**Description:** The composite GitHub Action downloads a pre-built
`tokmd` binary from `github.com/EffortlessMetrics/tokmd/releases/...` and
verifies it against `checksums.txt` (sha256). It does not verify a
cryptographic signature on the checksum file or on the release itself.
The download URL is interpolated from a user-supplied `version` input
without shell-unsafe character filtering.

**Why not a finding:**
- The action is a published action; consumers control which version
  they pin to. The check is bounded to a `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`-style
  string via the `${ver#v}` prefix logic.
- `curl -fsSL` rejects HTTP errors and follows redirects (only to
  HTTPS GitHub release endpoints in practice).
- The checksum verification, when checksums.txt is present, uses
  `sha256sum`/`shasum`/`Get-FileHash` to compare the downloaded
  binary's hash to the expected value.
- Build provenance is separately attested via
  `actions/attest-build-provenance@v4` in `release.yml`.
- Below the `medium` severity threshold; this is documented best-
  practice coverage.

**Recommended action (optional):** Add explicit format validation
for the `version` input (e.g., regex `^v?\d+\.\d+\.\d+(-[A-Za-z0-9.-]+)?$`)
and reject anything else before constructing the URL.

### OBS-006 (new): Empty 7-day commit window this scan

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Severity** | LOW (informational) |
| **STRIDE Category** | Repudiation |
| **File** | repo-wide commit log |
| **Status** | Not a finding — design choice |

**Description:** The 7-day scan window (2026-07-13 to 2026-07-20) contained
zero commits on `main`. The most recent commit is `5e8edc6 merge(swarm):
import steward docs manifest fix` dated 2026-07-04 (16 days old), which is
a true-merge import of metadata-only files (`.factory/`, `.claude/`,
`.jules/`, `.codex/`, `.cargo/`, `.githooks/`, `.github/`). No application
source was modified by any commit within the scan window.

**Why not a finding:** The lack of in-scope deltas is the security-relevant
property — there is no new code surface to introduce regressions. The
prior weekly scan on 2026-06-29 covered the same content. Standing
defenses were re-verified against the current `main` (see the table below)
and remain intact.
