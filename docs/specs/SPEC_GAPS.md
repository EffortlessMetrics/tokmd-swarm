# Spec Contract Gap Audit

- Status: draft
- Schema family, if any: n/a
- Related ADRs: `docs/adr/0000-adr-process.md`, `docs/adr/0009-proof-observation-promotion-boundary.md`
- Related proof scopes: `project_truth_docs`, `proof_control_plane`, `cockpit`

## Contract

This audit records which recurring tokmd contracts are already represented in
`docs/specs/` and which still need promotion from user docs, policy comments,
plans, or implementation-only behavior.

This file is an index and routing artifact. It does **not** promote new proof
requirements, policy gates, or release verdict behavior on its own.


## Inputs

This audit is derived from durable docs and machine-policy surfaces, including:

- `docs/specs/*.md`
- `docs/NEXT.md`
- `docs/source-of-truth.md`
- user-facing contract docs such as `docs/review-packet.md`, `docs/handoff.md`, and `docs/ci/coverage.md`
- machine-enforced policy sources under `ci/` and `policy/`

## Outputs

This file provides a routing-level inventory that classifies contract areas as
`specified`, `documented but not specced`, `policy-only`, `plan-only`, `needs ADR`,
or `deferred`.

The audit output is informational and should be used to scope follow-on spec,
ADR, policy, and verifier work.

## Compatibility

The gap audit must remain backward compatible with legacy top-level docs that
still hold active contract semantics. Promotion into `docs/specs/` should not
require deleting or rewriting user-facing docs in the same change.

## Classification Vocabulary

The status values in this audit use the following meanings:

- `specified`: durable behavior contract exists in `docs/specs/`.
- `documented but not specced`: user-facing or narrative docs exist, but no
  focused behavior contract spec exists yet.
- `policy-only`: behavior is encoded in TOML/config/checkers without a matching
  durable narrative contract.
- `plan-only`: sequencing exists, but durable contract text is missing.
- `needs ADR`: governance/boundary decision required before or alongside spec.
- `deferred`: intentionally postponed with documented reason and owner.

## Proof Requirements

Run these checks when updating this gap audit or introducing follow-on specs:

```bash
cargo xtask doc-artifacts --check
cargo xtask docs --check
cargo xtask proof-policy --check
git diff --check
```

For follow-on PRs that add new contracts, include `cargo xtask affected` and a
matching `cargo xtask proof --profile affected ... --plan` receipt in PR
artifacts.

## Open Questions

- Whether top-level legacy docs that currently hold contract semantics should be
  required to link to a successor file under `docs/specs/` once promoted.
- Whether this audit should be split into one row per checker-owned artifact
  family once the first promotion wave lands.
