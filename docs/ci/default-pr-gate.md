# Default PR gate (phase 2, #226)

The required merge check is **`Tokmd Rust Result`** — a single tight gate with
advisory `route`, serial `cargo xtask gate --check`, `cargo test --all-features`,
`cargo test -p xtask --all-features`, and `cargo xtask proof-policy --check`.
The separate `UB Review (Advisory)` job performs the independent agentic review
pass and does not hold the required gate open.

Parallel satellite lanes still run for MSRV, docs, deny, typos, risk-gated
builds, and proof planning. They are visible on the PR but are **not** aggregated
into a `CI (Required)` job; branch protection should require only `Tokmd Rust
Result` after the admin step in issue #226.

| Job | Now triggers on PR when... |
|-----|----------------------------|
| `Tokmd Rust Result` | always (required) |
| `Route CI runner` | always (advisory) |
| `UB Review (Advisory)` | pull_request on same-repository branches (advisory) |
| `MSRV Check` | always (satellite) |
| `Cargo Deny` | always (satellite) |
| `Typos` | always (satellite) |
| `Docs Check` | always (satellite) |
| `Feature Boundaries` | always (satellite) |
| `Publish Surface` | always (satellite) |
| `Version consistency` | always (satellite) |
| `Affected Proof Plan` | pull_request only |
| `Build & Test (Windows)` | label `windows` / `full-ci` (still on every push) |
| `Build & Test (macOS)` | push-only (unchanged) |
| `Wasm Compile & Test` | label `wasm` / `full-ci` |
| `Nix PR Package Gate` | label `nix` / `release-check` / `full-ci` |
| `Mutation Testing` | label `mutation` / `full-ci` |
| `Proptest Smoke` | label `property-tests` / `full-ci` |

## Retired lanes (folded into `Tokmd Rust Result`)

- `Quality Gate` → `cargo xtask gate --check` in the gate job background
- `Build & Test (Linux)` → `cargo test --all-features` in the gate job background
- `Proof Policy` → `cargo xtask proof-policy --check` in the gate job background
- `CI (Required)` → replaced by single required check + `CI Actuals (Advisory)`
- `Tokmd Rust Small Result` + routed `em-routed-rust-small.yml` frontdoor
  (`Route Tokmd Rust Small`, `Tokmd Rust Small on Self Hosted`, `Tokmd Rust
  Small on GitHub Hosted`) → retired in phase 3 (#299); routing folded into the
  `Route CI runner` lane of `ci.yml` and the required `Tokmd Rust Result` gate

## Advisory lane summary

`CI Actuals (Advisory)` publishes LEM receipts and a non-blocking lane table.
Only `failure` on **`Tokmd Rust Result`** blocks merge once branch protection is
updated.

Default-PR lanes marked `always` and `blocking` in the lane catalog must not be
moved behind a same-repository guard unless the PR also adds a separate hosted
fork-safe path. This includes cheap static proof such as `Typos` and the CI
Policy workflow's `No Bare Self-Hosted Routing` guard.

## Default-PR LEM after phase 2

Static floors per `policy/ci-lane-whitelist.toml` (refreshed 2026-07-02 against
hosted `ci-actuals`; see [timing-refresh-2026-07.md](timing-refresh-2026-07.md)):

                            83   tokmd-swarm default PR static estimate
```

Measured core CI jobs on an ordinary PR are ~16 LEM; the static total includes
advisory workflow lanes not in the aggregate `needs` payload. The estimate is
just above the elevated band (≤ 75 LEM) and well below the hard override ceiling.

The duplicate routed Rust Small frontdoor (`em-routed-rust-small.yml`) was
retired in phase 3 (#299). Runner routing for `tokmd-swarm` workbench PRs now
lives in the `Route CI runner` lane of `ci.yml`, and its check/test work is the
single required `Tokmd Rust Result` gate. The historical routing contract is
preserved in `docs/ci/routed-ci-policy.md`.

Phase-2 target for issue #226 is a single tight gate documented in
`docs/specs/ub-review-ci-gate.md`, with `cargo xtask ci-gate-contract`
enforcing the reference fixture and reporting the live `ci.yml` gap
advisory until migration lands.

## Anti-patterns

- Don't use `full-ci` to dodge a real failure; the deep lanes catch
  things the default lane is *intentionally* skipping.
- Don't apply per-pack labels to silence routing — fix the change.
- Don't depend on the matrix entry name "windows" appearing under
  `build` — the matrix split is intentional so `if:` can gate Windows
  independently.
